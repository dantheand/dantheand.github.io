description: I first learned to program through the development of this web application. This site &mdash; built on the Codeigniter PHP framework &mdash; is currently helping students at Santa Barbara City College learn taxonomical classifications. It is database-driven and has a fully-functional backend to manage the taxonomy database. Additionally, it is able to pull from standard online taxonomy databases to keep the content up-to-date.
