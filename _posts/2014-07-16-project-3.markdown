description: I first cut my programming teeth by developing this web application. This website &mdash; built on the Codeigniter PHP framework &mdash; was designed to help students learn taxonomical classifications. It is database-driven and has a fully-functional backend to manage the taxonomy database. Additionally, it is able to pull from standard online taxonomy databases to keep the content up-to-date.
